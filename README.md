# Films-MVC-DAO-CRUD
Project done in class using a teacher's code as base. I learned a lot about structural organization of a project connecting front-end and back-end.

This app uses nodemon for handling package dependecies. 
-npm install allows you to load them up into node_modules.
-npm run go runs the server at localhost:8383

## Description
This app uses web languages, TypeScript, and Bootstrap 5 library to make things look pretty.
I did not use an API for this project, instead having XAMPP to simulate a server for a local database containing a list of movies.

MVC pattern was used for handling user requests, deploy the correct function every time. For now, any user can add, view, delete and
update movies.
